# PockIt

A fast and easier way to earn pocket money.
The app looks similar to a FaceBook Feed, where the users post a notice of some job or task that needs to be done and some amount of money he/she is willing to pay for the one doing the job.(They pay this amount to the app, which later is paid to the one who did it.)
Other users of the app can see the post,if willing to do so, they can accept the job and once they're done, they are paid, through the app.
If no other user accepts the task, money is refunded back within a deadline opted by the person who posted.
Tasks that can be posted:
  ->Picking up or delivering a parcel
  ->Groceries shopping
  ->Gardening
  ->Help in house-hold chores
  ->Maintanance help - Plumbers, carpenters, mechanics, electricians,etc, required.
  ->First-Aid help
  ->Looking out for Tutors.
 
This app can be used as an advertising platform.
